# FifteenPuzzleAI

The aim of this project is to develop a *mobile application* using a *cross platform framework*. The application I decided to build is an implementation of the *Fifteen Puzzle Game*. I decided not only to develop the game, but also to add an Artificial Intelligence Agent, trained using *Reinforcement Learning*, that can help the player to perform the next move or to play instead of the user for a while.
